# Overview

As a software engineer, Iâ€™m constantly looking to improve my understanding of new languages, frameworks, and design patterns. In this project, I built a RESTful API using Java and Spring Boot to reinforce my understanding of object-oriented programming, REST principles, and the structure of Java-based applications.

The software is a Task Management API that allows users to create, read, update, delete, and export tasks. Each task includes fields such as title, description, due date, and priority. The API also includes filtering capabilities and demonstrates file I/O, interface usage, and integration with Java collections.

This project allowed me to explore Spring Boot's annotation-based approach, dependency injection, HTTP request mapping, and how to manage state with in-memory data using JpaRepository.
